Okay, so I want to change the Simple engine to run on a monthly basis instead of a half-yearly basis as it is today. Could you review the code in @simulation_engine.py and the documentation in @simulation_engine.md  to see what the implications would be and present your findings? We would also need to change the way we load data. So the @generate_office_config.py would also need to change, and possibly some changes to the front-end.  Do this review and present you findings and tasks
