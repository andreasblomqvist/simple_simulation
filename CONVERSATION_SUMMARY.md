# SimpleSim Enhancement Conversation Summary

## Date: 2025-01-02

## Key Accomplishments âœ…

### 1. Progression Data Integration (COMPLETED)
- **Problem**: Scenarios weren't including progression_config and cat_curves data
- **Solution**: Updated ScenarioService.getDefaultProgressionConfig() to include proper nested structure
- **Result**: New scenarios now automatically include progression configuration
- **Test Scenario Created**: ID `ae7c7e1a-d73c-49a5-a2e4-3a209f6826e3`
- **Simulation Verified**: ID `79aab3ad-cb3b-4217-b483-fb2d2595bde8`

### 2. Office-Specific CAT Matrix Design (IN PROGRESS)
- **Insight**: Each office should have its own CAT matrix for cultural differences
- **Design**: Comprehensive office-specific progression configuration system
- **Status**: Design completed, implementation pending

### 3. Comprehensive Office Object Model (DESIGNED)
- **Enhanced Office Structure**: Physical space, detailed expenses, operational management
- **Financial Planning**: Multi-year budgets, cost centers, profitability analysis
- **Regional Factors**: Cultural practices, market conditions, compliance
- **Status**: Full design completed, ready for implementation

## Current Focus: Detailed Budget Structure

### Budget Screenshot Analysis
- User provided detailed budget breakdown showing hierarchical expense structure
- Need to design SimpleSim expense model matching this level of detail
- Categories include:
  - Recruitment Budget
  - Sales Revenue tracking
  - Project Costs (Consultant, Sub-consultant)
  - Detailed Expenses (Salaries with subcategories, Office costs, Travel, etc.)
  - EBITDA calculations

## Next Steps
1. Design detailed expense data models based on budget screenshot
2. Remove hardcoded progression values (use backend APIs instead)
3. Implement office-specific CAT matrices
4. Create comprehensive expense tracking system

## Technical Notes
- Fixed progression config structure: `{levels: {...}}` and `{curves: {...}}`
- Backend missing `/api/config/progression` endpoint
- Frontend has hardcoded values in multiple locations
- Test scenario successfully created and simulated

## Key Files Modified
- `/frontend/src/services/scenarioService.ts` - Fixed progression config structure
- `/test-scenario.json` - Comprehensive test scenario with progression data
- Multiple todo tasks completed (see TodoWrite tool results)

## Outstanding Issues
- Hardcoded progression values need removal
- Backend API endpoints for configuration needed
- Office-specific progression system to implement
- Detailed budget structure to design and implement
