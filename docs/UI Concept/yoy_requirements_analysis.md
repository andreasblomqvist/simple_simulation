# Analysis of Year-by-Year Navigation Requirements

## Functional Requirements Summary

1.  **Year Selector**: The system must include a prominent and easy-to-use year selector to navigate through simulation results. This selector will allow users to view data for specific years within a multi-year simulation.
2.  **Year-over-Year KPI Changes**: The UI must display year-over-year changes for key KPIs. This includes:
    *   Financial metrics (margin, revenue, costs)
    *   Growth metrics (headcount, growth rate)
    *   Seniority distribution (journey percentages)
3.  **Visual Indicators**: Visual cues (e.g., up/down arrows, percentages) are required to clearly indicate year-over-year changes in KPIs.
4.  **Maintain Detailed View**: The detailed view (KPIs, charts, and data tables) should update to reflect the data for the currently selected year.
5.  **Data Export**: The system must support exporting data for specific years.

## Design Considerations Summary

1.  **Prominent Year Selector**: The year selector should be easily discoverable and intuitive to use, likely placed in a header or control panel area.
2.  **Visually Distinct KPI Changes**: Year-over-year changes in KPIs should be clearly distinguishable, using color (e.g., green for positive, red for negative) and directional indicators.
3.  **UI Consistency**: The new year-over-year navigation elements must integrate seamlessly with the existing UI design, maintaining the Ant Design aesthetic.
4.  **Clear Visualizations**: Year-over-year trends should be presented using clear and effective visualizations (e.g., line charts for progression).
5.  **Mobile Responsiveness**: The design must be responsive to ensure a good user experience on various devices, especially for executive review on tablets or mobile phones.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1.  **Month-by-month navigation**: The focus is solely on year-level progression.
2.  **Real-time simulation adjustments**: This feature is for viewing results, not for live simulation manipulation.
3.  **Historical data storage for previous simulation runs**: The scope is limited to the current simulation run's year-by-year data.
4.  **Complex year-over-year comparisons across different simulation runs**: Comparisons are within a single simulation run.

## Technical Considerations Summary

1.  **Data Structure Modification**: The simulation engine needs to structure output data by year.
2.  **Year-level Aggregations**: KPIs must be aggregated at the year level.
3.  **Efficient Data Loading**: Ensure that navigating between years is fast and responsive.
4.  **Backward Compatibility**: The new features should not break existing API functionalities.
5.  **Caching**: Consider implementing caching mechanisms for year-level data to improve performance.

This analysis will guide the integration of year-over-year navigation into the existing UI design.
