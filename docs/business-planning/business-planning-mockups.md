## Mockup 1: Seniority Distribution Planning
**Goal: Achieving 50% Journey 1 Target Distribution**

### Context Bar
```
Business Planning > Talent Strategy > Seniority Distribution Analysis
[Create Scenario] [Compare Current] [Export Report] [Filter: All Offices]
```

### AI Planning Conversation

**AI Assistant**: I've analyzed your current seniority distribution across all offices. You're at 38% Journey 1 consultants, which is 12 percentage points below your 50% target. 

**User**: "What's driving this gap? Our progression rates seem reasonable."

**AI**: Based on historical data:
- **Progression bottleneck at A3→B1**: Only 65% promotion rate (target: 75%)
- **Extended tenure in A-levels**: Average 18 months vs. target 15 months
- **Retention challenge**: 15% of A3s leave before B1 promotion

**Recommendations:**
1. **Accelerate A2→A3 progression** (+2 months earlier)
2. **Implement A3 retention program** (target high performers)
3. **Increase B1 promotion slots** (+20% capacity)

### Progression Planning Section
```

┌─ Progression Pipeline Analysis ─────────────────────────┐

│ High-Performer Retention: 85% (✓ above 80% threshold)  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**AI**: "Would you like me to model scenarios where we increase A3→B1 promotions by 15% and implement retention initiatives? I can show the impact on reaching your 50% target."

**User**: "Yes, and also show what happens if we need to transition some stagnated seniors."

## Mockup 2: Internal Career Progression vs External Hiring
**Strategic Decision: Grow vs Buy Talent**

### AI Conversation

**AI**: You're planning 25% FTE growth. I've modeled two scenarios:

**Scenario A: Internal Progression Focus** (Recommended)
- Promote 40% more A3→B1 (cost: $180K additional salaries)
- Recruit 60 Junior/Young Professionals (cost: $2.4M)
- **Time to productivity**: 6-8 months
- **Cultural alignment**: 95% retention after 2 years

**Scenario B: External Senior Hiring**
- Recruit 15 external B2/B3 consultants (cost: $1.8M)
- **Time to productivity**: 3-4 months
- **Cultural risk**: 70% retention after 2 years
- **Team dynamics impact**: May demotivate internal progression

**User**: "The external hiring looks cheaper upfront..."

**AI**: Consider total cost of ownership:
- External B2 failure cost: $150K (recruitment + training + backfill)
- Internal progression builds organizational knowledge
- **Recommendation**: Blend approach - 80% internal progression, 20% strategic external hires for specific skills

### Financial Impact Modeling
```
┌─ 3-Year Cost Comparison ────────────────────────────────┐
│ Internal Progression: $4.2M total                      │
│ ├─ Recruitment (60 JCP): $2.4M                        │ 
│ ├─ Progression costs: $0.8M                           │
│ └─ Retention bonus program: $1.0M                     │
│                                                        │

│ ├─ Senior recruitment: $1.8M                          │
│ ├─ Failure/replacement costs: $1.8M                   │
│ └─ Junior backfill: $1.5M                            │

## Mockup 3: Active Churn Management 
**Performance Management & Strategic Transitions**

### AI Analysis Dashboard

**AI**: I've identified performance management opportunities:

**Stagnation Risk Analysis:**
- **8 C-level consultants** with <70% utilization (6+ months)
- **12 B3 consultants** with no progression in 24+ months
- **Project feedback scores** below team average

**User**: "We need to address the stagnated seniors. What are our options?"

**AI**: Three strategic approaches:

### Performance Transition Planning
```
┌─ Stagnated Senior Analysis ─────────────────────────────┐
│ C2/C3 Low Performers (8 people):                       │
│ ├─ Average tenure: 4.2 years                          │
│ ├─ Utilization: 65% (vs 85% target)                   │
│ ├─ Client feedback: 3.2/5 (vs 4.0 team avg)          │
│ └─ Revenue impact: -$480K annually                    │
│                                                        │
│ B3 Progression Stuck (12 people):                     │
│ ├─ Time in level: 26 months (vs 18-24 target)        │
│ ├─ Promotion readiness: 30% (vs 70% for promotable)   │
│ └─ Flight risk: 40% (considering external moves)      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**AI Recommendations:**
1. **Performance Improvement Plans** (3-month timeline)
2. **Transition to advisory roles** (retained knowledge, reduced cost)
3. **Managed departures** with succession planning
4. **Internal mentorship programs** for B3 progression blockers

**User**: "Model the impact of transitioning 6 stagnated seniors and accelerating B3 progressions."

**AI**: "Transitioning 6 C-levels and promoting 8 B3s would:
- **Save $420K annually** in underperformance costs
- **Open promotion pipeline** for high-performing A3s
- **Improve team utilization** by 8 percentage points
- **Strengthen culture** through merit-based advancement"

## Mockup 4: Seasonal Recruitment Strategy
**Young Professional Year-Round vs Junior Seasonal Patterns**

### Recruitment Planning Interface

**AI**: Your recruitment strategy shows distinct patterns:

**Young Professionals (Year-Round):**
- Target: 36 hires annually (3 per month steady state)
- **Peak months**: January (onboarding), September (career fairs)
- **Success rate**: 78% offer acceptance
- **Cost per hire**: $8,500

**Junior Consultants (Seasonal):**
- Target: 24 hires (Q2: 60%, Q4: 40%)
- **Campus recruiting**: February-May pipeline
- **Summer internship conversion**: 45% conversion rate
- **Cost per hire**: $12,000 (includes campus program)

### Seasonal Capacity Planning
```
┌─ Recruitment Timeline & Capacity ──────────────────────┐
│ Q1: YP Focus (12 hires) + Campus Outreach             │
│ Q2: Junior Heavy (15 hires) + YP (9 hires)           │
│ Q3: YP Steady (9 hires) + Internship Program         │
│ Q4: Junior Completion (9 hires) + YP (6 hires)       │
│                                                        │
│ Hiring Manager Capacity:                               │
│ ├─ Q2 Peak: 24 interviews/month (at capacity)        │
│ ├─ Need 2 additional interviewers April-May          │
│ └─ Training pipeline: 8 weeks new hire→billable      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**User**: "Can we increase YP hiring to reduce campus dependency?"

**AI**: **Analysis shows**:
- **YP market depth**: Can support 50% increase (54 annually)
- **Quality impact**: Maintained at current standards
- **Cost trade-off**: Lower per-hire cost but less campus brand presence
- **Recommendation**: Pilot 42 YP hires next year, maintain core campus program for brand

## Mockup 5: Growth vs Distribution Balance
**Achieving FTE Growth While Improving Seniority Mix**

### Strategic Planning Dashboard

**AI**: Your dual objectives create interesting tensions:

**Primary Goals:**
- **25% FTE growth** (180 → 225 consultants)
- **50% Journey 1 distribution** (currently 38%)
- **Maintain revenue per FTE** ($180K target)

### Growth vs Quality Trade-offs

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**User**: "Which scenario best balances our talent development goals?"
