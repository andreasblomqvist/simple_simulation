# Product Requirements Document: Business Planning

## 1. Introduction/Overview

The Business Planning system is a comprehensive replacement for Planacy that provides a modern, web-based interface for creating, managing, and executing business plans within SimpleSim. The system enables users to create detailed monthly recruitment targets, sales forecasts, cost estimates, and workforce plans that serve as baseline inputs for organizational simulations.

**Core Vision**: Create a version of Planacy where users can create business plans that will serve as baseline input to scenarios, including functionality for aggregated business plans that combine all offices' plans into one global baseline for scenario input.

### Current Implementation Status
- **Backend**: 70% complete with full API infrastructure, data models, and business logic
- **Frontend**: 40% complete with basic components and state management
- **Integration**: Business plans can serve as simulation baselines (existing capability)

## 2. Goals

- **Replace Planacy Integration**: Eliminate dependency on external Planacy system
- **Simulation Baseline Creation**: Enable business plans to serve as baseline input for scenarios
- **Office-Level Planning**: Support detailed monthly planning for individual offices
- **Aggregated Global Planning**: Combine multiple office plans into company-wide baselines
- **Professional UI Experience**: Match or exceed Planacy's usability and visual polish

### Technical Goals
