## Detailed Bug Analysis

### 1. Rate Scaling Errors

| Level | Expected Rec% | Actual Rec% | Scale Factor | Expected Churn% | Actual Churn% | Scale Factor |
|-------|---------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|--------------|
| A     | 1.27%         | 14.53%      | **11.4x**    | 0.15%           | 1.65%         | **11.0x**    |
| AC    | 0.28%         | 4.86%       | **17.4x**    | 0.14%           | 2.49%         | **17.8x**    |
| AM    | 0.00%         | 0.07%       | N/A          | 0.04%           | 1.28%         | **32.0x**    |
| C     | 0.04%         | 1.00%       | **25.0x**    | 0.08%           | 1.92%         | **24.0x**    |
| M     | 0.00%         | 0.00%       | N/A          | 0.07%           | 0.85%         | **12.1x**    |
| SrC   | 0.01%         | 0.20%       | **20.0x**    | 0.05%           | 1.47%         | **29.4x**    |
| SrM   | 0.00%         | 0.00%       | N/A          | 0.10%           | 0.48%         | **4.8x**     |

**Pattern**: Average scaling factor of ~18x suggests systematic unit conversion error.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Root Cause: Percentage vs Decimal Conversion Error

**Evidence:**
1. **Consistent 18x scaling**: Suggests systematic unit error, not random bugs
2. **Pattern matches percentage confusion**: 1.27% treated as 1.27 decimal = ~18x error when applied as percentage
3. **All levels affected**: Indicates fundamental parameter handling issue
4. **Claude AI works correctly**: Same baseline parameters produce expected results

### Technical Explanation

**What's happening:**
```
Baseline: 1.27% recruitment rate
Your engine likely does:
1. Loads 1.27 (as decimal, not 0.0127)
2. Applies as percentage: 1.27% of population
3. Result: 1.27% instead of 0.0127% = 100x error
4. Observed ~18x suggests partial correction but still wrong
```

**Why Claude AI works:**
- Correctly interprets 1.27% as 0.0127 decimal
- Applies proper rate calculations
- Results match baseline expectations perfectly

---

## Specific Bugs to Fix

### 1. Parameter Loading Bug (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Issue**: Baseline percentage rates incorrectly converted to decimals
**Fix**: Ensure 1.27% becomes 0.0127, not 1.27

```python
# WRONG (likely what your engine does):
recruitment_rate = 1.27  # Treats percentage as decimal

# CORRECT (what Claude AI does):
recruitment_rate = 1.27 / 100  # or 0.0127
```

### 2. Rate Calculation Bug (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Issue**: Rate application may be missing division by 100
**Fix**: Verify rate calculations use proper decimal values

```python
# WRONG:
recruited = population * recruitment_rate_percent

# CORRECT:
recruited = population * (recruitment_rate_percent / 100)
```

### 3. Level-Specific Parameter Bugs (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Issue**: Some levels show inconsistent scaling (4.8x to 32x range)
**Fix**: Check parameter loading for each level individually

### 4. Aggregation Issues (LOW PRIORITY)
**Issue**: Multi-office/role data may compound errors
**Fix**: Verify aggregation logic doesn't double-apply rates

---

## Debugging Steps

### Immediate Actions (Do First)
1. **Check parameter input format**
   - Verify how baseline rates are loaded (1.27 vs 0.0127)
   - Test with simple round numbers (1.0% = 0.01)

2. **Isolate single level test**
   - Run simulation for Level A only
   - Compare month-by-month with expected values

3. **Verify rate calculation logic**
   - Check if rates are divided by 100 when applied
   - Ensure percentage rates become decimal multipliers

### Validation Tests
1. **Simple parameter test**: Use 1.0% rate, expect 1% monthly growth
2. **Single month test**: Verify one month calculation manually
3. **Single office test**: Run one office only to isolate aggregation issues

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Parameter loading: Are percentages converted to decimals?
- [ ] Rate application: Is division by 100 applied correctly?
- [ ] Population updates: Is FTE count updated after each calculation?
- [ ] Aggregation: Are multi-office/role rates handled correctly?
- [ ] Time steps: Are monthly calculations applied properly?

## Expected Fixes

### Fix 1: Parameter Conversion
```python
# Before (WRONG):
params = {
    'A': {'recruitment_rate': 1.27, 'churn_rate': 0.15}
}

# After (CORRECT):
params = {
    'A': {'recruitment_rate': 0.0127, 'churn_rate': 0.0015}
}
```

### Fix 2: Rate Application
```python
# Before (WRONG):
recruited = int(current_fte * recruitment_rate)

# After (CORRECT):
recruited = int(current_fte * recruitment_rate / 100)
# OR if rates already converted:
recruited = int(current_fte * recruitment_rate_decimal)
```

### Expected Results After Fix
- Level A: Should grow from 163 to ~318 (95.1% growth)
- Level AC: Should grow from 231 to ~251 (8.7% growth)
- Level C: Should decline from 356 to ~348 (-2.2% decline)
- Overall: Should match Claude AI results within 1-2%

## Business Impact

### Current Impact of Bugs
- **Strategic planning**: Completely unreliable projections
- **Resource allocation**: Massive over/under-estimation of needs
- **Financial forecasting**: Revenue projections severely distorted
- **Growth targets**: Impossible to set realistic goals

### Post-Fix Benefits
- **Accurate projections**: Match baseline expectations
- **Reliable planning**: Can trust simulation for business decisions
- **Consistent results**: Reproducible outcomes
- **Stakeholder confidence**: Credible modeling approach

## Testing & Validation

### Regression Tests to Implement
1. **Baseline validation**: Automated comparison against expected parameters
2. **Claude AI comparison**: Regular validation against reference implementation
3. **Simple parameter tests**: Known inputs with predictable outputs
4. **Edge case testing**: Zero rates, high rates, boundary conditions

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All levels within 5% of Claude AI results
- [ ] Baseline deviation < 10% total
- [ ] Consistent results across multiple runs
- [ ] Logical growth patterns (positive rates = growth)

## Conclusion

Your simulation engine has a **fixable but critical bug** in parameter handling. The 18x scaling error strongly indicates a percentage vs decimal conversion issue that can be resolved with proper parameter loading and rate calculation fixes.

**Priority Actions:**
1. Fix parameter conversion (percentages to decimals)
2. Verify rate application logic
3. Test with simple parameters
4. Validate against Claude AI results

**Expected Outcome:** After fixes, your engine should match Claude AI's accuracy and produce reliable business projections.

The good news is that this appears to be a systematic error with a clear fix, rather than complex logic bugs requiring major redesign.
