# Product Requirements Document: Office-Specific Views

## Introduction/Overview

The Office-Specific Views feature will provide dedicated pages for each office within the SimpleSim system, allowing users to manage office configurations, run simulations, view insights, and adjust business plans from a focused, office-centric interface. This feature will enhance the user experience by providing a centralized location for all office-related activities while maintaining consistency with the existing system design.

## Goals

1. **Centralized Office Management**: Provide a dedicated interface for managing individual office data, configurations, and business plans
2. **Enhanced User Experience**: Create an intuitive, office-focused workflow that reduces navigation complexity
3. **Comprehensive Insights**: Display relevant KPIs and metrics specific to each office
4. **Seamless Simulation Integration**: Enable users to run and analyze simulations directly from the office view
5. **Multi-Office Support**: Allow users to edit and manage multiple offices from a consistent interface
6. **Data Consistency**: Ensure all office data and configurations are synchronized across the system

## User Stories

1. **As a user**, I want to access a dedicated page for each office so that I can focus on managing that specific office's data and configurations.

2. **As a user**, I want to edit office configurations directly from the office view so that I can quickly adjust settings without navigating through multiple pages.

3. **As a user**, I want to run simulations for a specific office so that I can analyze growth scenarios and business outcomes.

4. **As a user**, I want to view comprehensive KPIs and insights for an office so that I can understand its current performance and trends.

5. **As a user**, I want to download reports and analysis for an office so that I can share results with stakeholders.

6. **As a user**, I want to adjust business plans and see real-time calculations so that I can plan future growth and resource allocation.

7. **As a user**, I want to switch between different offices easily so that I can manage multiple offices efficiently.

8. **As a user**, I want to see consistent UI/UX across all office views so that I can work efficiently without learning different interfaces.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Office Navigation**: The system must provide a way to navigate to and between different office views.

2. **Office Configuration Management**: The system must allow users to view and edit office configurations directly from the office view.

3. **Business Plan Integration**: The system must integrate with the business planning feature to allow users to adjust recruitment, sales, cost, and staff data for the specific office.

4. **Simulation Execution**: The system must allow users to run simulations for the specific office and view results.

5. **KPI Dashboard**: The system must display relevant KPIs including growth rate, margin, headcount, seniority distribution, journey analysis, revenue, and cost.

6. **Report Generation**: The system must allow users to generate and download reports for the specific office.

7. **Multi-Office Editing**: The system must allow users to edit configurations and business plans for any office, not just their own.

8. **Real-time Calculations**: The system must provide real-time updates when business plan data is modified.

9. **Data Validation**: The system must validate all office data and configurations before allowing simulations or saving changes.

10. **Consistent UI/UX**: The system must maintain visual and interaction consistency with the rest of the SimpleSim application.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **User Role Management**: User permissions, roles, and access control are not included in this feature.
2. **Audit Trail**: Change tracking and history are not included in this feature.
3. **External System Integration**: Integration with HR, finance, or other external systems is not included.
4. **Advanced Notifications**: Real-time notifications for changes or simulation completion are not included.
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Mobile-specific UI/UX optimizations are not included in this feature.

## Design Considerations

- **Consistent Design Language**: Use the same design patterns, components, and styling as the existing SimpleSim interface
- **Responsive Layout**: Ensure the office view works well on different screen sizes
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Provide clear navigation between office views and other system features
- **Data Visualization**: Use charts and graphs to display KPIs and insights effectively
- **Loading States**: Provide appropriate loading indicators for data fetching and simulation execution

## Technical Considerations

- **Data Model Integration**: Leverage existing office configuration and business planning data models
- **API Reuse**: Utilize existing API endpoints for office configuration, simulation, and KPI calculations
- **State Management**: Ensure proper state management for office-specific data and configurations
- **Performance**: Optimize data loading and calculations for individual office views
- **Error Handling**: Provide clear error messages and recovery options for failed operations

## Success Metrics

1. **User Adoption**: 80% of users access office-specific views within the first week of release
2. **Task Completion**: Users can complete office management tasks 50% faster than using the current interface
3. **Data Accuracy**: 100% of office configurations and business plans are correctly saved and synchronized
4. **Simulation Success**: 95% of simulations run successfully from the office view
5. **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback from users regarding the office-focused workflow

## Open Questions

1. **Office Selection**: How should users initially select which office to view (dropdown, search, list)?
2. **Default View**: What should be the default tab/section when entering an office view?
3. **Bulk Operations**: Should users be able to perform bulk operations across multiple offices?
4. **Data Export Formats**: What specific formats should be supported for report downloads?
5. **Offline Capabilities**: Should any office data be available offline or in read-only mode?
6. **Performance Thresholds**: What are the acceptable loading times for office data and simulations?
