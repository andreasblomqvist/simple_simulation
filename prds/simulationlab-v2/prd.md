# SimulationLab V2: Enhanced UI with Year-by-Year Navigation

## Introduction/Overview
The current simulation interface, while functional, suffers from visual clutter and lacks year-over-year navigation capabilities essential for executive decision-making. SimulationLab V2 addresses these issues by implementing a completely redesigned interface based on the comprehensive UI analysis documented in `docs/UI Concept/`. This new version provides year-by-year navigation, simplified user interactions, and enhanced KPI visualization while maintaining 100% feature parity with the original interface.

## Goals
1. **Reduce Visual Clutter**: Achieve 40% reduction in visible UI elements through card-based, collapsible layout
2. **Enable Year Navigation**: Provide intuitive year-by-year navigation for multi-year simulation analysis
3. **Enhance Decision Making**: Improve executive capability to track margin progression and strategic goals
4. **Maintain Feature Parity**: Ensure all existing functionality is preserved and enhanced
5. **Improve User Experience**: Streamline workflows and reduce cognitive load for faster task completion

## User Stories
