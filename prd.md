# SimpleSim UI Complete Rebuild - Product Requirements Document

**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: January 29, 2025  
**Product**: SimpleSim Workforce Simulation Platform UI Rebuild  

## Product overview

### Complete UI rebuild for SimpleSim workforce simulation platform

This project represents a comprehensive rebuild of the SimpleSim frontend from the ground up, addressing critical architectural fragmentation and implementing a modern dashboard experience using shadcn/ui components. The current implementation suffers from dual layout systems, component fragmentation, mixed design systems, and business logic embedded in UI components, making it unmaintainable and unreliable.

### Product summary

SimpleSim is a workforce simulation platform that enables organizational growth modeling, workforce planning, and scenario analysis. The current frontend has evolved into a fragmented mess with multiple competing systems:

- **Dual Layout Systems**: AppShell vs AppLayoutV2 causing confusion and conflicts
- **Component Fragmentation**: Multiple versions of wizards, dashboards, tables with no clear standard
- **Mixed Design Systems**: V2 components, legacy components, design system conflicts
- **Business Logic in UI**: ScenarioWizardV2 and similar components mixing concerns
- **Routing Complexity**: AppRoutes vs EnhancedRoutes dual systems

This rebuild will create a unified, maintainable system following shadcn dashboard-01 patterns while preserving all existing functionality.
