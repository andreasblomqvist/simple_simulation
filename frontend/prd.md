## Product overview

### Document title
SimpleSim UI Migration to shadcn/ui Components

### Product summary
This project will complete the migration from Ant Design to shadcn/ui components in the SimpleSim workforce simulation platform. The application is currently broken with 58+ TypeScript errors, non-functional components, and dev server crashes due to an incomplete migration. This comprehensive migration will restore full functionality while implementing a modern, professional UI based on the dashboard-01 design pattern from shadcn/ui.

SimpleSim is a React-based workforce simulation platform with a FastAPI backend that enables organizational growth modeling, workforce planning, and scenario analysis. The frontend currently has mixed dependencies with partially migrated components causing system instability and poor user experience.

## Goals
