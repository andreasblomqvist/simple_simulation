### Notes
- **CRITICAL BUG FIXED**: Integer truncation in scenario_resolver.py that caused 8/12 offices to receive 0 churn
- Office system focuses on absolute values rather than proportional distribution
- Business plans become baseline input for scenarios (individual or aggregated)
- Journey-based organization: Emerging, Established, Mature offices
- Monthly business planning with 5 parameters per role/level combination

## Critical Bug Fix (Immediate Priority)

- [x] **URGENT: Fix integer truncation bug in scenario_resolver.py line 272**
  - **Issue**: `int(proportional_value)` causes systematic distribution failure
  - **Impact**: 8 out of 12 offices receive 0 churn despite having workforce
  - **Fix**: Replace `int()` with `round()` for more accurate distribution
  - **Status**: COMPLETED - Fix applied to scenario_resolver.py
