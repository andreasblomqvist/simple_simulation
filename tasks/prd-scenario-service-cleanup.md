# Product Requirements Document: Scenario Service Cleanup

## Introduction/Overview

The current `scenario_service.py` acts as an orchestrator for scenario execution but has grown to handle multiple responsibilities including validation, data transformation, and result serialization. This creates a monolithic service that is difficult to test, maintain, and extend. The goal is to refactor this service to follow better separation of concerns, improve type safety, and enhance maintainability.

## Goals

1. **Improve Separation of Concerns**: Move validation, data transformation, and serialization logic to dedicated services
2. **Enhance Type Safety**: Standardize on using Pydantic models throughout the service layer
3. **Improve Testability**: Break down the monolithic service into smaller, injectable components
4. **Standardize Error Handling**: Implement consistent error handling patterns across the service
5. **Enhance Logging**: Add structured logging with proper context and traceability
6. **Clean Up Code Quality**: Remove unused imports, improve documentation, and standardize naming

## User Stories

- **As a developer**, I want the scenario service to be easily testable so that I can write comprehensive unit tests
- **As a developer**, I want clear separation of concerns so that I can modify one aspect without affecting others
- **As a developer**, I want consistent error handling so that I can debug issues more effectively
- **As a developer**, I want structured logging so that I can trace scenario execution and debug problems
- **As a developer**, I want type-safe interfaces so that I can catch errors at compile time rather than runtime

## Functional Requirements

1. **Extract Validation Logic**: Move all validation logic from scenario service to a dedicated validator service
2. **Extract Data Transformation**: Move dict-to-model conversion logic to dedicated transformer services
3. **Implement Error Handling Decorators**: Create reusable error handling decorators for consistent error management
4. **Add Structured Logging**: Implement structured logging with context (scenario ID, user, execution time)
5. **Standardize Model Usage**: Ensure all internal logic uses Pydantic models instead of raw dictionaries
6. **Extract Scenario Definition Logic**: Create a helper service for handling scenario definition extraction and validation
7. **Improve Result Serialization**: Use Pydantic's built-in serialization instead of custom recursive functions
8. **Add Dependency Injection**: Make all dependencies injectable for better testability
9. **Clean Up Imports**: Remove unused imports and organize import statements
10. **Improve Documentation**: Add comprehensive docstrings for all public methods

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Changing the external API interface
- Modifying the simulation engine logic
- Changing the data models or database schema
- Adding new features or functionality
- Performance optimizations (unless they result from the refactoring)

## Design Considerations

- **Backward Compatibility**: All external APIs must remain unchanged
- **Minimal Disruption**: Changes should be internal only, not affecting other services
- **Incremental Refactoring**: Changes should be made incrementally to minimize risk
- **Test Coverage**: All refactored code must have comprehensive test coverage

## Technical Considerations

- **Dependency Injection**: Use constructor injection for all dependencies
- **Error Handling**: Implement consistent error handling with proper error types
- **Logging**: Use structured logging with correlation IDs for traceability
- **Type Safety**: Use Pydantic models throughout the service layer
- **Testing**: Ensure all components are easily mockable and testable

## Success Metrics

- **Test Coverage**: Achieve >90% test coverage for the refactored service
- **Code Quality**: Reduce cyclomatic complexity and improve maintainability scores
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses across all endpoints
- **Logging**: Structured logs with proper context for all operations
- **Type Safety**: No runtime type errors due to improved type checking

## Open Questions

- Should we implement a custom logging formatter for structured logs?
- Do we need to create new Pydantic models for internal data structures?
- Should we implement a circuit breaker pattern for external service calls?
- Do we need to add metrics collection for monitoring scenario execution?
