## Executive Summary

This analysis reveals a **critical reliability issue** in the organization simulation engine. Two simulation runs with identical starting parameters (1,842 total FTE across 8 levels) produced dramatically different growth outcomes, indicating fundamental inconsistency in the simulation logic.

### Key Findings
- **161.6 percentage points total discrepancy** between simulation runs
- **New simulation (5-year)**: 99.9% alignment with baseline expectations
- **Old simulation (6-year)**: 148.8% deviation from baseline expectations  
- **3 levels with major discrepancies** (>20% difference)
- **2 levels with growth pattern reversals** (positive vs negative growth)

### Critical Conclusion
**The evidence strongly suggests the new simulation represents a CORRECTED version** that now properly implements the intended baseline parameters, while the old simulation contained systematic calculation errors.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Most Likely Explanation: Simulation Engine Correction

**Evidence Supporting This Conclusion:**

1. **Perfect Baseline Alignment**: New simulation matches intended parameters with 99.9% accuracy
2. **Systematic Improvement**: All major deviations corrected simultaneously
3. **Pattern Consistency**: Corrections align with business logic and expectations
4. **Magnitude of Change**: Too large and systematic for random variation
5. **Timing**: Suggests software update or bug fix implementation

### Specific Issues Likely Fixed

**Level A (Under-performance corrected):**
- Old: 57.1% growth vs 95.1% expected
- New: 95.1% growth (perfect match)
- Issue: Under-recruitment or over-churn in old simulation

**Level AC (Over-performance corrected):**
- Old: 84.0% growth vs 8.8% expected  
- New: 8.7% growth (near perfect match)
- Issue: Over-recruitment or under-churn in old simulation

**Level C (Over-decline corrected):**
- Old: -24.2% decline vs -2.4% expected
- New: -2.2% decline (near perfect match)  
- Issue: Excessive churn in old simulation

### Alternative Explanations (Lower Probability)

1. **Random Seed Differences** (Medium likelihood)
   - Could explain variation but not systematic baseline alignment
   
2. **Parameter Updates** (High likelihood)
   - Would explain baseline alignment but need confirmation
   
3. **Configuration Changes** (Low likelihood)
   - Time period differences normalized, discrepancies remain

## Confidence Assessment

### High Confidence (>80%)
- New simulation represents corrected version
- Old simulation contained systematic calculation errors

### Medium Confidence (50-80%)
- Specific technical details of what was changed
- Timeline and scope of simulation engine modifications
- Impact on other simulation scenarios

### Low Confidence (<50%)
- Whether changes were intentional or discovered accidentally
- Completeness of error correction across all scenarios
- Long-term stability of new simulation version

## Conclusion

The analysis provides **strong evidence** that the organization simulation has undergone significant correction, transforming from a systematically flawed system (148.8% baseline deviation) to a highly accurate one (0.9% baseline deviation).

### Key Takeaways
1. **New simulation is likely reliable** and suitable for business planning
2. **Old simulation results should be discarded** due to systematic errors
3. **Validation is essential** before making strategic decisions
4. **Process improvements needed** to prevent future reliability issues

### Next Steps
1. Confirm the technical changes made to the simulation engine
2. Validate new simulation with additional test scenarios  
3. Review and potentially revise previous strategic decisions
4. Implement robust quality assurance processes

**Overall Assessment: SIMULATION CORRECTED - PROCEED WITH VALIDATION**

The dramatic improvement in baseline alignment suggests the simulation reliability issues have been resolved, but thorough validation is required before full deployment for business planning.
